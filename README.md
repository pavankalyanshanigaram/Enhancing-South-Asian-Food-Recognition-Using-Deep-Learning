# Enhancing-South-Asian-Food-Recognition-Using-Deep-Learning
Built a deep CNN with SE blocks, attention mechanisms, and EfficientNet transfer learning for dish classification. Optimized the model with ONNX (graph optimizations + quantization) for faster inference and deployed via Flask API + Docker. Developed a Streamlit UI for real-time predictions, enabling a complete end-to-end ML solution.
# üçΩÔ∏è Dish Classification using Deep Learning

## üìå Overview

This project implements an **end-to-end deep learning pipeline for dish classification**, leveraging **EfficientNet with transfer learning**, **Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) blocks**, and **attention mechanisms** to achieve high accuracy. The model is optimized for real-time inference and deployed as a **Flask REST API** containerized with **Docker**, along with a **Streamlit web UI** for user interaction.

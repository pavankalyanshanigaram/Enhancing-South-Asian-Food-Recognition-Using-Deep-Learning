# Enhancing-South-Asian-Food-Recognition-Using-Deep-Learning
Built a deep CNN with SE blocks, attention mechanisms, and EfficientNet transfer learning for dish classification. Optimized the model with ONNX (graph optimizations + quantization) for faster inference and deployed via Flask API + Docker. Developed a Streamlit UI for real-time predictions, enabling a complete end-to-end ML solution.
